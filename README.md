Course project proposal for Advanced Machine Learning

## Understanding CapsuleNets  
In this project I introduce a new concept introduced in 2019 called CapsuleNets and how these networks alleviate the limitations present in the current Covnvolutional Neural Networks.
Feel free to have a look at the proposal for my submission towards this undergraduate course project.
